<h1 align = 'center'> 👋 Hi, I’m Mike. </h1>
👀 I’m interested in a Project or Program Management role with an emphasis in Technology. <br></br>
🌱 I’m currently studying for AZ-900, AI-900, AZ-104, GitHub Foundations, SEC+, and PMP. <br></br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any tracking of projects or programs! <br></br>
📫 Reach me at michael.pelletiere@outlook.com or michael.t.pelletiere@gmail.com. You can also find out more about me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-pelletiere. <br></br>
⚡ Fun fact: I love spending my time outdoors! Either snowboarding in the winter or trail running in the summer, no season can keep me out of the mountains! Also, I love the Rubik's Cube and fun puzzles! <br></br>
